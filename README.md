# Drowsiness-Detection-using-7-pretrained-models
This project presents a deep learning-based drowsiness detection system that evaluates and compares the performance of seven popular pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures:
  VGG19  
  ResNet50V2  
  MobileNetV2  
  Xception  
  InceptionV3  
  DenseNet169  
  InceptionResNetV2

The goal is to identify the most efficient model in terms of accuracy, inference speed, and model size for real-time drowsiness detection applications. This work is relevant for use cases such as driver monitoring systems and fatigue detection in high-risk workplaces.

Features
  Preprocessing of eye and face images
  Transfer learning using pretrained ImageNet weights
  Model performance comparison (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)

Tech Stack
  Python
  TensorFlow / Keras


Future Work
